# Hotel Management System

This is a simple Hotel Management System developed in Java that allows you to efficiently manage hotel room bookings and perform administrative tasks. It provides options for listing available rooms, booking rooms, and an admin menu for adding new rooms to the system. The system is designed with a basic command-line interface to make it user-friendly.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Hotel Management System, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your system.
- A **Java IDE** or a text editor to edit and compile the code.

## Usage

1. **Clone or Download**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. **Open Main.java**: Open the Java file `Main.java` in your preferred Java development environment.

3. **Customize Admin Password**: Modify the admin password as needed. By default, the admin password is set to "22SW013."

4. **Compile and Run**: Compile and run the `Main.java` file.

5. **Interact with the System**: Use the following options to interact with the Hotel Management System:

   - **List Available Rooms**: Shows a list of available rooms.
   - **Book a Room**: Allows you to book a room by providing guest information and room choice.
   - **Admin Menu**: Accesses the admin menu, which lets you add new rooms to the system.
   - **Exit**: Exits the system.

Please note that the admin password should be modified for security purposes. Replace the placeholder "22SW013" with a strong and secure password in the code.

## Admin Menu

The admin menu is protected with a password to ensure only authorized users can add new rooms to the system. To access the admin menu, follow these steps:

1. Enter the admin password (default: "22SW013") when prompted.

2. Choose from the following admin menu options:

   - **Add Room**: Add a new room to the system by providing room number, type, and price.
   - **Exit Admin Menu**: Exit the admin menu and return to the main menu.
